# Autonomous AI Agent Application – Development Guide & Feature Sheet

## Introduction  
Building an **autonomous AI agent** called **Multi-RoleAI** that can execute tasks independently across multiple domains. This application will go beyond traditional AI assistants by not just providing responses but actually executing complex tasks with minimal human intervention. This guide outlines the features, technology stack, development roadmap, and deployment considerations for a self-hosted autonomous agent that integrates with various tools and can work asynchronously in the cloud. The goal is to enable users to delegate complex tasks to an AI agent that can plan, execute, and deliver results while they focus on other activities.

## Feature List  

**Core Features (MVP):**  
- **Autonomous Task Execution:** The AI agent can **independently execute complex tasks** without constant human supervision. Once given a goal, the agent breaks it down into steps, plans the execution, and carries out the necessary actions to achieve the goal. This includes tasks like research, data analysis, content creation, and more.

- **Multi-Agent Architecture:** The system uses a **multi-agent approach** where specialized agents work together to accomplish tasks. This includes agents for planning, research, coding, writing, and other specialized functions, all orchestrated by a main controller agent.

- **Tool Integration:** The agent can **interact with external tools and applications**, including:
  - Web browsers for research and information gathering
  - Code editors and interpreters for writing and executing code
  - File system for document management and organization
  - Data visualization tools for creating charts and graphs
  - Database systems for structured data management

- **Multi-Modal Processing:** The agent can work with different types of data:
  - Text (generating reports, answering questions, writing content)
  - Code (writing, debugging, and executing programs)
  - Basic image analysis (if available through the AI model)
  - Data processing and analysis

- **Task Planning and Monitoring:** The system provides a **visual representation of task progress**, showing the steps the agent is taking, current status, and estimated completion time. Users can monitor the agent's work and intervene if necessary.

- **User Accounts & Private Workspaces:** **Multi-user support** with authentication so each user has a private workspace. Users must log in (with username/email and password) and can only access their own tasks and documents. This ensures privacy in a small team setting.

- **Asynchronous Processing:** Tasks continue to run even when the user is offline, with results waiting when they return. The agent works in a cloud environment that persists independently of the user's device.

**Advanced Features (Post-MVP):**  
- **Deployment System ("Spaces"):** A feature to **deploy web applications** created by the agent. This includes containerization, domain management, and monitoring of deployed applications.

- **Advanced Document Management:** Comprehensive **document creation and editing** capabilities with rich text formatting, version history, and collaboration features. Documents can be created, edited, and organized by both users and the AI agent.

- **Sandboxed Execution Environment:** A secure, **isolated environment** for running code and executing tasks, preventing potential security issues while allowing the agent to work with various programming languages and tools.

- **Adaptive Learning:** The agent can **learn from user feedback** and past interactions to improve its performance over time. This includes remembering user preferences, common tasks, and successful approaches.

- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Multiple users can **work together with the agent** on the same task, with live updates and notifications. This enables team-based workflows where both humans and AI contribute to a project.

- **Advanced Security Features:** Comprehensive **security measures** including permission systems for tool access, content filtering, rate limiting, and resource allocation to prevent misuse or excessive consumption.
