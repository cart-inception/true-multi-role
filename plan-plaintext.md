Great, I’ll put together a development guide and feature sheet for building a web app similar to manus.im, using the Anthropic API and Windsurf Cascade. It will focus on a desktop-first browser experience with support for multi-user authentication and workspaces. I’ll also recommend technologies and resources that align well with Windsurf Cascade. I’ll get back to you shortly with a complete breakdown.

# AI-Powered Document Editor Web App – Development Guide & Feature Sheet

## Introduction  
Building a **Manus.im-inspired web application** involves creating a **secure, AI-assisted document editor** for a small group of users (1–3 people) on a self-hosted VPS. This guide outlines the features, technology stack, development roadmap, and deployment considerations for a desktop-first web app that integrates Anthropic’s Claude API as a writing assistant. The goal is to enable users to create and manage documents with help from an AI, all within their private workspaces. We also highlight frameworks and tools that work well with Windsurf Cascade – an AI-powered coding assistant – to streamline development. 

## Feature List  

**Core Features (MVP):**  
- **Document Creation & Editing:** Users can **create, edit, and format documents** in a rich text or Markdown editor. The editor should support basic formatting (headings, bold/italic text, lists, etc.) and possibly syntax highlighting for code blocks.  
- **AI Writing Assistant (Claude Integration):** An **AI sidekick** helps with writing tasks. Users can interact in a **chat-style sidebar or panel** alongside the editor to get suggestions, ask questions, or generate text. The AI (Anthropic Claude) can provide context-aware assistance like summarizing text, suggesting edits, expanding outlines, or answering questions about the document’s content ([Build with Claude \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/api#:~:text=Productivity)). The assistant’s responses appear in a conversational format, and users can optionally insert AI-generated content into the document.  
- **Chat Interface for AI:** A **chat-like interface** (similar to ChatGPT or Claude’s chat) allows iterative prompts and responses. This could be implemented as a persistent sidebar conversation or a toggle between editing mode and chat mode. The conversation history helps the AI maintain context across prompts, enabling more coherent assistance.  
- **Document Management:** Ability to **organize documents** – e.g., create and delete documents, and group them into folders or tag them. Users should see a list of their documents (maybe in a sidebar or dashboard) and open any document for editing. Basic search or filter by title is a plus.  
- **User Accounts & Private Workspaces:** **Multi-user support** with authentication so each user has a private workspace. Users must log in (with username/email and password) and can only access their own documents. This ensures privacy in a small team setting – e.g., User A cannot see User B’s documents without explicit sharing.  
- **Secure Authentication:** A **secure login system** (e.g., JWT or session-based auth) with hashed passwords. Basic account management (login, logout, password reset or change) is included. Given the small user count, a simple email/password auth is sufficient for MVP. Administrator access (for the app owner) can allow inviting new users or monitoring the system.  

**Optional / Nice-to-Have Features:**  
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Two or more users editing the *same* document simultaneously with live updates (like Google Docs). This is complex to implement (requires operational transform or CRDT algorithms for concurrency), so it’s a stretch goal beyond MVP.  
- **Document Sharing:** Ability to **share a document** with another user (grant view or edit access). For instance, user A could invite user B to collaborate on or read a specific document. This requires permission management (document-level ACLs).  
- **Version History:** Track changes or maintain **version history** for documents. Users could view previous versions or revert changes. Even a basic *history of AI suggestions applied* might be useful to undo AI-introduced errors.  
- **Import/Export & Backup:** Features to **import documents** (e.g. upload a Markdown or text file into the app) and **export** to formats like PDF, DOCX, or Markdown for offline use. Regular backups (or an export all data option) would enhance data safety.  
- **Rich Media Support:** Inserting images or attachments into documents. For example, a user could upload an image to embed in the document. (This entails file storage management on the server.)  
- **AI Tool Extensions:** Beyond writing help, the AI could perform **additional tasks**. For example: summarize a selection of text, translate text, check grammar, or even execute small code snippets if the document is code-related. These could be accessed via special commands or UI buttons (e.g., a “Summarize” button). Using Anthropic’s Claude tools mechanism, the AI can even be allowed to edit documents directly via an API tool if implemented, though this is advanced ([Text editor tool - Anthropic API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/text-editor-tool#:~:text=Claude%20can%20use%20an%20Anthropic,your%20code%20or%20other)).  
- **Mobile-Friendly Interface:** While the app is desktop-first, a responsive design for mobile viewing or light editing is nice to have. This ensures users can read or make quick edits on phones/tablets, though heavy editing might remain easiest on desktop.  
- **Themes / UI Customization:** Options for dark mode or UI theme switching. This is mostly a UI enhancement for user comfort during extended writing sessions.  
- **Analytics/Admin Dashboard:** For the owner/admin, basic stats like number of documents, usage of the AI (how many queries made to Claude), etc. This can help monitor costs if the Anthropic API is billed per use, and ensure no misuse.  
- **Notifications:** If relevant, in-app notifications or email alerts (for example, if a shared document is edited by someone, or an AI task is completed asynchronously). This is minor for a small user base but can improve UX in certain workflows.

*(Note: The app can function fully offline apart from the AI assistant. All documents reside on the VPS. The Anthropic API calls will require internet access, but documents and user data remain self-hosted.)*

## Development Roadmap  

**Phase 1 – MVP Implementation:** Focus on getting the essential features working end-to-end.  
1. **Core Backend Setup:** Set up the server with user authentication and document CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Implement a database schema for Users and Documents (each document linked to a user account). Start with a simple data model: e.g., `User(id, name, email, password_hash)` and `Document(id, owner_id, title, content, created_at, updated_at)`. Ensure password hashing and basic auth workflows (login, signup).  
2. **Basic Frontend UI:** Develop a **desktop-first web interface**. This includes a login page, a registration page (if self-signup is allowed), and the main app interface. The main interface likely has a sidebar listing documents and a main editor area. For MVP, you could use a simple text area or a basic rich text editor component for the document content. Implement the ability to create a new document, edit (and live-save) the content, and list/delete documents. Keep the design minimal but functional.  
3. **Integrate AI Assistant (Anthropic Claude):** Implement a rudimentary chat interface alongside the editor. This involves front-end components for chat messages (user and AI messages) and an input box to send prompts. On the back-end, set up an API route that accepts a prompt (and possibly conversation history) and calls the Anthropic Claude API. For MVP, you can send the document content as context with the prompt to get relevant responses. Start with basic interactions, e.g., user asks the AI to continue writing the document or to summarize it. The backend forwards this request to Claude and returns the completion. Focus on making a single-turn interaction work first, then add keeping track of conversation history so Claude has context. **Ensure you handle API keys securely** (e.g., load the Anthropic API key from an environment variable, not hard-coded).  
4. **Testing & Refinement:** Once core features are in place, test with a couple of dummy users. Verify that one user cannot access another’s documents via the API (authorization checks working). Test the AI assistant with various prompt scenarios to ensure it responds appropriately. At this stage, refine the prompt formatting for Claude to steer it for your use case (you might send a system prompt describing it as a writing assistant and include the user’s text as context). Also, implement basic error handling (e.g., API errors, timeouts, or content that Claude refuses) and show error messages to the user as needed.  
5. **UI Polish:** Before moving on, do some UI improvements within the MVP scope. For example, make sure the layout is responsive enough for different screen sizes (desktop-focused but not broken on mobile). Add loading indicators when waiting for AI responses. Ensure the document list and editor updates without full page refresh (use AJAX or front-end state management for seamless UX).

**Phase 2 – Enhanced Features:** After the MVP is functional, iterate to add improvements and nice-to-haves prioritized by usefulness:  
- **Rich Text Editor Upgrade:** Replace or enhance the basic editor with a more powerful component that supports formatting (bold, headings, etc.) and perhaps Markdown preview. Libraries like **TipTap or Slate.js** (for rich text) or a Markdown editor can be integrated. This will allow users to produce well-formatted documents. Also enable **copy-paste** of content and images if possible.  
- **Advanced AI Interactions:** Make the AI assistant more sophisticated. For example, allow the user to highlight text in the document and ask the AI to act on that selection (e.g., “improve this paragraph” or “translate this section”). You can send the highlighted text in the prompt to Claude to get a targeted suggestion. Additionally, include preset AI actions (buttons) such as “Summarize document” or “Fix spelling/grammar” that automatically send the appropriate prompt. If Anthropic’s API supports streaming, implement streaming responses so the AI’s reply appears word-by-word for better UX (this makes the app feel more responsive).  
- **Multi-user & Sharing Enhancements:** If needed for your use case, implement document sharing between users. This would involve creating a join table (e.g., `DocumentShare(doc_id, user_id, permission)`) and API logic to grant/revoke access. Shared docs could appear in a “Shared with me” section for users. Also consider if roles (admin, normal user) are needed – for a small team, perhaps one admin account to manage system-wide settings.  
- **Search and Organization:** Add a search bar to search document titles or even full text (full-text search could use a library or database index if many documents). Implement folder categorization or tags for documents so users can organize their workspace as it grows.  
- **UX Improvements:** Introduce features like **dark mode toggle**, user profile settings (e.g., to change password). If a design system or UI library wasn’t used earlier, you can now refine the UI with a consistent style (maybe integrate a component library or custom CSS using a framework like Tailwind CSS for easier maintenance). Ensure the interface is **accessible** (good contrast, keyboard navigable).  
- **Performance & Scaling:** For 1–3 users, performance is not a big issue, but if documents become large (e.g., dozens of pages of text), ensure the editor and AI calls handle it. You might implement pagination or lazy-loading for extremely large documents, or limit how much content is sent to the AI (since even Claude has context length limits). If using Claude’s 100k token context model (Claude 2), you can feed very large documents, but monitor response times and costs.  
- **Monitoring & Feedback:** Add admin-visible logs or an interface to monitor AI usage (number of calls, average response time) and possibly a way to view application logs in the UI. This can help in debugging and optimizing. Also, consider collecting user feedback within the app (even if the users are just your team) to continuously improve the tool.  

**Future Iterations (Long-term Ideas):**  
- **Autonomous Agent Capabilities:** Manus.im is known for its autonomous agent features (executing multi-step tasks). In the future, you could extend the AI assistant into an **autonomous agent** that can perform multi-step operations like those Manus showcases – e.g., researching a topic online and compiling results into a report. This would involve integrating tools (web requests, external APIs) that the AI can use. Frameworks like LangChain or the tools system in Claude could be explored then. This is a complex feature and would come after core functionality is stable.  
- **Collaboration & Real-Time Editing:** Revisit real-time collaboration if it’s a strong need. Implementation could use something like **ShareDB or Yjs** for real-time OT/CRDT, coupled with WebSocket communication between clients. This would allow live cursors, changes, and possibly even AI suggestions in real-time to all viewers of a document.  
- **Plugin Ecosystem:** If the user base grows or your team has diverse needs, consider a plugin system where new AI skills or document processing modules can be “plugged in”. For example, a plugin to integrate a grammar-checker or connect to an external knowledge base.  
- **Mobile App or Desktop App:** Down the line, you could package the app as a desktop app (using Electron or Tauri) or a mobile app (using React Native or Flutter) for a more native experience. Given it’s a web app on a VPS, frameworks like Tauri can wrap it with minimal changes.  
- **Scaling for More Users:** Although initially for a small team, if you ever wanted to open it to more users, you’d need to implement rate limiting on AI usage, more robust caching, and possibly load balancing or separate worker processes for handling AI queries to prevent any single user from hogging resources.  

The roadmap above ensures that the **Minimum Viable Product** is delivered first, and then progressively enhanced. Each phase builds upon the previous, allowing feedback-driven development.

## Suggested Architecture and Tech Stack  

Choosing a suitable architecture is crucial for smooth development and integration with AI. Since you plan to use **Windsurf Cascade** (AI-assisted IDE) to build the app, we recommend opting for **mainstream, well-documented frameworks** that Cascade can easily work with. Windsurf’s Cascade excels at understanding large, multi-file codebases and making context-aware changes ([Windsurf vs. Cursor: A Developer’s Dilemma | by Murat Aslan | CodeX | Medium](https://medium.com/codex/windsurf-vs-cursor-a-developers-dilemma-451a228d4d43#:~:text=,about%20hitting%20a%20usage%20cap)). It can even detect required packages and help install or configure them ([Windsurf - Cascade](https://docs.codeium.com/windsurf/cascade#:~:text=Cascade%20has%20a%20variety%20of,15%2C%20and%20the%20terminal)), which will speed up development if you use popular libraries. With that in mind, here’s an architecture that fits the requirements:

### Frontend (Client-side)  
- **Framework:** **React** (with TypeScript) for building a dynamic, responsive UI. React is widely supported and will pair well with AI coding assistance and existing templates. You could use **Next.js** (a React framework) to get server-side rendering and routing out of the box, or a simpler setup like Vite + React for a pure client-side single-page app. Next.js is a strong option because it allows creating API routes and pages in one project, simplifying deployment (monolithic app).  
- **UI Components & Styling:** Use a modern UI library or CSS framework to accelerate UI development. For example, **Tailwind CSS** provides utility classes to rapidly style your components, which can be easier with AI helpers (you can describe the design and Cascade may help apply the correct classes). In fact, an Anthropic Claude writing app tutorial chose React with Tailwind for a fast, customizable UI ([Anthropic Claude Tutorial: Building a Simple and Safe Collaborative Writing App tutorial](https://lablab.ai/t/anthropic-claude-tutorial-building-a-simple-and-safe-collaborative-writing-app#:~:text=Introducing%20React%20and%20TailwindCSS)). Alternatively, consider component kits like **Shadcn UI** or **Material-UI** which come with pre-built components. Using a popular component library with Next.js can greatly speed up development and ensure a polished look; the combination of Next.js with a UI kit is known to be a powerful solution for rapid development ([Top 8 Most Popular Open-Source Next.js SaaS Templates - DEV Community](https://dev.to/bytefer/top-8-most-popular-open-source-nextjs-saas-templates-1pma#:~:text=shadcn,recommended%20by%20Awesome%20Shadcn%20UI)).  
- **State Management:** For a small app, React’s built-in state and Context API might suffice. If the app grows in complexity, you might introduce a state management library (like Redux or Zustand) to handle global state (e.g., user info, theme, or cached documents) across components.  
- **Editor Component:** Instead of building a text editor from scratch, integrate an open-source **rich text editor component**. For example, **TipTap (built on ProseMirror)** offers a flexible rich-text editing experience and can be extended with custom commands (like triggering AI actions). It also has good TypeScript support. Other options include **Slate.js**, or even simpler Markdown editors like **SimpleMDE** if you go the Markdown route. Choosing a popular editor ensures you can get help from AI (and community) for integration issues.  
- **AI Chat UI:** Implement the chat interface on the frontend. This could be a component that shows a scrollable chat history and an input box. Each chat message can be a styled component (user vs assistant styling). You might also include small controls like a “copy response to document” button on the AI’s replies. The chat component will communicate with the backend via HTTP or WebSocket to send user prompts and receive AI responses. For simplicity, start with HTTP POST requests for each prompt and poll or long-poll for the response (or use server-sent events). Later, if you want streaming, a WebSocket or EventSource connection could be maintained for real-time token streaming.  

### Backend (Server-side)  
- **Language & Framework:** You have flexibility here. Two solid approaches are:  
  - **Node.js with Express / Next.js API Routes:** Using Node and Express (or the built-in API routes of Next.js) would keep your stack in JavaScript/TypeScript end-to-end. Express is minimalist and lets you add any libraries needed. If using Next.js, you can create API route files that act as your backend endpoints. This unified approach means less context-switching (Windsurf Cascade can navigate your front and back code easily since all are in one project). The Node ecosystem has libraries for all required pieces (database, auth, calling external APIs, etc.).  
  - **Python with Flask (or FastAPI/Django):** If you prefer Python, Flask is a lightweight web framework suitable for an API server ([Anthropic Claude Tutorial: Building a Simple and Safe Collaborative Writing App tutorial](https://lablab.ai/t/anthropic-claude-tutorial-building-a-simple-and-safe-collaborative-writing-app#:~:text=We%20will%20be%20employing%20Flask,development%20of%20intricate%20RESTful%20APIs)). Python’s `anthropic` library (if available) can be used to call Claude’s API, and you can use ORM libraries like SQLAlchemy for the database. FastAPI is another great choice for an asynchronous Python backend with modern features (and it has interactive docs, which can be nice for testing your API). Django could be used for its robust auth and admin system, but it’s heavier if you’re mostly building a SPA (you might disable a lot of the templating since React will handle UI).  
  *Both approaches are valid.* If you want to maximize compatibility with Windsurf’s AI agent, the Node/Next.js route might be slightly smoother (since the AI can handle one unified TypeScript codebase and Cascade has features like running `npm install` on detected packages ([Windsurf - Cascade](https://docs.codeium.com/windsurf/cascade#:~:text=Cascade%20has%20a%20variety%20of,15%2C%20and%20the%20terminal))). However, if you are more comfortable in Python, Cascade can still assist in Flask code – it might just be a split between front (JS) and back (Python) projects. The decision can also depend on what libraries you prefer for auth and DB.  
  
- **Database:** Use a **SQL database** to store users and documents. **PostgreSQL** is a robust choice for production (and is well-supported by ORMs in both Node and Python). For a small user count and relatively low data volume, even **SQLite** can suffice initially (especially if using a Node ORM like Prisma or a Python ORM that supports SQLite). SQLite keeps things simple (no separate DB service needed) but if you go with Next.js (which may run multiple server instances), a single-file SQLite might face concurrency issues. PostgreSQL (or MySQL/MariaDB) provides reliability for multiple users. You can run Postgres on the same VPS. Use an ORM for convenience: **Prisma** (Node/TS) or **TypeORM** for Node, or **SQLAlchemy** for Python, to interact with the database in code. This will make it easier to write queries and migrations, and Cascade can help generate ORM models and queries with correct syntax by looking at your code context.  
- **Authentication:** Implementing auth securely is critical. If using Next.js, **NextAuth** could be a quick solution – it supports credential logins and even social logins if needed, managing sessions for you. For Express or Flask, you might use libraries like **Passport.js** (Node) or **Flask-Login/JWT** for Python. Given the small scope, a simple JWT-based auth or session cookie system is fine. Ensure to hash passwords (e.g., using bcrypt). If you want to avoid building auth from scratch, you could integrate a SaaS service like **Auth0** or **Clerk** for authentication – they provide UI and storage for user accounts, and your app just uses their SDK. (However, using third-party auth means trusting them with user data; if privacy is a concern, rolling out your own auth or using an open source solution is better.)  
- **AI Integration (Anthropic API):** On the server, create a module or service that interacts with the Anthropic Claude API. This will likely involve using HTTP calls to Anthropic’s endpoint with the API key. You can use an official SDK if available (Anthropic had a Python SDK and possibly Node bindings) or direct REST calls. For each user prompt, the backend will send a properly formatted request to Claude including the prompt, any system instructions, and context (like document content or chat history). Because Claude can handle large context windows, you could include the entire current document text (if not too massive) along with the conversation so far. The backend then streams or returns Claude’s reply to the frontend. Take care to implement **safety checks** – e.g., limit the length of user prompt or document content sent to avoid excessive token usage, and perhaps filter any obviously disallowed content from being sent (to comply with Anthropic’s policies). Also, handle rate limiting or errors (Claude might refuse certain requests or the API might rate limit if overused).  

- **API Design:** Define clear API endpoints for the frontend to use. For example:  
  - `POST /api/auth/login` and `POST /api/auth/register` (or use NextAuth which abstracts this)  
  - `GET /api/documents` (list current user’s docs), `POST /api/documents` (create new), `GET /api/documents/{id}` (fetch one, with content), `PUT /api/documents/{id}` (update content or title), `DELETE /api/documents/{id}`.  
  - `POST /api/assistant` (send a prompt to the AI, possibly include a document id or content).  
  If using Next.js API routes, these could be implemented in the `/pages/api` directory. For Flask/Express, you’d create similar routes. Ensure each request verifies the user’s identity (e.g., check a session or JWT) and enforces authorization (user can only fetch their own document, etc.).  

### Integration with Windsurf Cascade  
Windsurf Cascade can significantly accelerate development of this project by automating repetitive coding tasks and maintaining context across files. By selecting mainstream frameworks as suggested, you allow Cascade to leverage its strengths: it can **“pull relevant pieces of code from various parts of the codebase”** to inform its suggestions ([Windsurf vs. Cursor: A Developer’s Dilemma | by Murat Aslan | CodeX | Medium](https://medium.com/codex/windsurf-vs-cursor-a-developers-dilemma-451a228d4d43#:~:text=,about%20hitting%20a%20usage%20cap)). For instance, if you ask it to create a new API route, Cascade might automatically reference your database models and import the required modules without you explicitly pointing to them. It’s even capable of recognizing missing dependencies and installing them. As noted in documentation, Cascade has tools to detect which packages are needed and can execute installation commands upon your approval ([Windsurf - Cascade](https://docs.codeium.com/windsurf/cascade#:~:text=Cascade%20has%20a%20variety%20of,15%2C%20and%20the%20terminal)). This means as you add features (say you decide to use a new library for the editor or auth), the AI assistant can handle some setup steps. 

To get the best results with Cascade:  
- **Keep code modular and well-named:** Write functions and components with clear names (e.g., `saveDocument`, `fetchDocumentsList`) so that the AI can infer their usage. Cascade will then more easily generate code that ties these pieces together.  
- **Leverage Cascade’s multi-step capability:** You can ask the AI to perform multi-step modifications. For example, “Add a new field to the Document model and update all relevant CRUD endpoints to handle it” – Cascade can try to execute this across model, controller, and UI files in one go. Always review the changes, as AI may not get everything perfect, but this can save time.  
- **Use Cascade’s web search or documentation features if needed:** If you or the AI need to recall how a certain Anthropic API call works or how to configure NextAuth, Cascade can do a quick web search within the IDE ([Windsurf - Cascade](https://docs.codeium.com/windsurf/cascade#:~:text=Quick%20links%20to%20features)), pulling in documentation context. This can help integrate unfamiliar libraries quickly (for instance, searching for “NextAuth credentials provider setup”).  

In summary, a **JavaScript/TypeScript front-end and back-end** with React/Next.js plus a SQL database is a strong, Windsurf-friendly architecture for this app. It offers a cohesive development experience and plenty of community examples (and likely similar projects that the AI has been trained on), making AI assistance more effective. Alternatively, a split Python(Flask) + React approach is also viable if you prefer Python’s ecosystem – Cascade can handle context in both, but integration between two repositories might require a bit more manual guidance.

## Data Privacy and Security Considerations  

Building on a personal VPS provides control over your data, but you must still enforce good security practices to protect user content and credentials. Below are key privacy and security considerations:

- **Secure Transport (HTTPS):** All web traffic must be encrypted to prevent eavesdropping. Set up **HTTPS (SSL/TLS)** for your domain – you can use Let’s Encrypt to get free certificates. This ensures that login credentials and document data aren’t exposed in transit. Additionally, when calling the Anthropic API, you’ll be making HTTPS requests, which is encrypted by default. Encryption in transit is crucial since you will be sending potentially sensitive document text to Anthropic’s servers ([Data Security Concerns with Self-Hosted versus Remotely-Hosted LLMs | by Mike O'Shea | Medium](https://medium.com/@oshea00/data-security-concerns-with-self-hosted-versus-remotely-hosted-llms-eb0bd1ce3705#:~:text=Data%20Security%20Consideration%3A%20Data%20security,policies%20to%20avoid%20data%20leakage)).  
- **Authentication & Access Control:** Use proven methods to store passwords (e.g., bcrypt hashing with salt) and implement **access controls** in the backend. Every API endpoint should verify the user’s session or token, and restrict actions to that user’s data. For example, user A should not succeed in fetching user B’s document by modifying an ID in the request – the server should check ownership. Implementing robust access checks and **role-based permissions** (if roles are used) helps prevent data leaks across accounts ([Data Security Concerns with Self-Hosted versus Remotely-Hosted LLMs | by Mike O'Shea | Medium](https://medium.com/@oshea00/data-security-concerns-with-self-hosted-versus-remotely-hosted-llms-eb0bd1ce3705#:~:text=%2A%20Encryption%3A%20Use%20end,compliance%20with%20data%20protection%20regulations)).  
- **Data Encryption at Rest:** Consider encrypting sensitive data on the server. For a personal project, this might simply mean ensuring the VPS’s disk is encrypted (many cloud providers allow you to enable disk encryption). At the application level, since the data (documents) isn’t highly sensitive in a corporate sense, storing them in plain text in the database might be acceptable. However, if documents are highly confidential, you could encrypt certain fields in the database. Manage encryption keys carefully (they should not be hard-coded in the repo).  
- **Anthropic API Data Handling:** Be aware that when you send document content to Claude, that data is processed by Anthropic. **Review Anthropic’s data retention and usage policies.** Typically, providers state they don’t use your API data to train models and retain it only temporarily for abuse monitoring, but you should confirm this in their documentation. If privacy is paramount, an alternative is to use a self-hosted large model instead, but that’s a trade-off with quality. In general, limit sending any truly sensitive personal identifiers or data to the API if possible (or obfuscate them) to reduce exposure.  
- **Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention:** Since this is a private app for trusted users, abuse is unlikely. But implementing basic rate limiting on the AI endpoint can prevent a buggy client or malicious actor from spamming the API (which could rack up cost or get your API key revoked). Likewise, if the app will be accessible on the open internet, you might want to throttle login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks on passwords.  
- **Server Security:** Harden your VPS since it will host application and database data. Use a firewall (e.g., UFW on Ubuntu) to close all ports except those needed (port 80/443 for web, maybe 22 for SSH). Regularly update the system packages to get security patches. It’s wise to run the web app under a non-root user account. If using Docker, keep your images updated to patch any vulnerabilities.  
- **Dependency Management:** Keep an eye on your app dependencies (NPM or Pip packages). Use tools (or Cascade’s suggestions) to update packages when security fixes come out. A vulnerable third-party library can become an entry point for attackers.  
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Maintain logs for both application and server access. For instance, log user logins, document access, and AI usage in the backend (but avoid logging the content of documents or prompts to protect privacy – log metadata like “user X requested a summary at 10:00AM”). Monitor logs for any unusual activity. On the server, you can use fail2ban to ban IPs that show malicious signs (many failed logins, etc.).  
- **Backups and Data Recovery:** Implement a backup routine for your database (and any uploaded files). Since it’s a personal server, you could do something like a cron job to dump the Postgres database to an encrypted file and (optionally) ship it to a secure cloud storage or another machine. This protects against data loss from server failure. Ensure backups themselves are stored securely (encrypted at rest, access-controlled).  

By self-hosting, you inherently avoid some privacy issues (your data isn’t on a multi-tenant cloud service besides the AI API), but it also means **you are responsible for security**. Following best practices like encryption, access control, and regular updates will keep the application and its data safe ([Data Security Concerns with Self-Hosted versus Remotely-Hosted LLMs | by Mike O'Shea | Medium](https://medium.com/@oshea00/data-security-concerns-with-self-hosted-versus-remotely-hosted-llms-eb0bd1ce3705#:~:text=%2A%20Encryption%3A%20Use%20end,compliance%20with%20data%20protection%20regulations)).  

## Deployment and Maintenance on a VPS  

Deploying on a personal Virtual Private Server means you’ll manage the entire stack – which grants flexibility but requires careful setup. Here’s a guide for deployment and ongoing maintenance:

- **Server Setup:** Choose a reliable Linux distribution for your VPS (Ubuntu LTS is a common choice with lots of community tutorials). Install required system packages: for example, Node.js (if using Node backend) or Python (if using Flask), and the database (PostgreSQL if chosen). If using Node, install a stable LTS version of Node.js. For Python, ensure you use a virtual environment or container. Also, install **Git** to pull your code, and setup a non-root user for running the app.  
- **Domain and DNS:** If you have a custom domain for the app, point a DNS record (A record) to your VPS’s IP. This will allow you to access the app via a nice URL (e.g., `docs.yourdomain.com`). Even if it’s just for personal use, a domain with HTTPS is cleaner than an IP address.  
- **Reverse Proxy and SSL:** It’s common to use a reverse proxy like **Nginx** or **Caddy** in front of your application. This can handle SSL termination and serve static files efficiently. For example, you can run your Node/Flask app on an internal port (say 3000) and have Nginx listen on 80/443, forwarding requests to the app. Use Let’s Encrypt (via Certbot or Caddy’s automatic HTTPS) to get an SSL certificate. The reverse proxy can also enforce some security (like HTTP > HTTPS redirects) and do gzip compression of responses.  
- **Deployment Strategy:** Decide how you will run the app on the server: 
  - *Option 1:* **Directly** (bare metal) – e.g., using a process manager. If Node, tools like **PM2** or **forever** can daemonize your app to keep it running and auto-restart if it crashes. If Python, you might use a WSGI server like **Gunicorn** (for Flask/Django) possibly in combination with **Supervisor** or systemd to manage the process.  
  - *Option 2:* **Docker containers** – Containerizing the app can simplify dependency management. You could have one container for the web app and one for the database. Using **Docker Compose** can help orchestrate this (with a YAML file defining the services). For a Node app, the Dockerfile would start the Next.js or Express server. For a Python app, the Dockerfile would run Gunicorn. If you use Docker, ensure you still configure volumes for persistent data (especially the database data directory if using a Postgres container). Some find Docker easier for consistency (works the same on any machine) but it adds a layer of complexity (you need to maintain the Dockerfiles).  
- **Environment Variables & Secrets:** On the server, configure environment variables for sensitive settings – e.g., `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, database connection URL, a session secret for signing cookies, etc. In a Node environment, you might use a `.env` file or supply vars via the process manager. Never hard-code these secrets in your code repository. If using Docker, you can pass them in via Compose file or Docker secrets. It’s good to also set environment variables for things like the app environment (production vs development) so that you can enable production optimizations (like Next.js’s production build, or Flask’s production mode).  
- **Building the App:** If using Next.js or a frontend build step, you might need to build the production assets on the server (or build locally and upload). Ensure you run the build (e.g., `npm run build`) then start the app (`npm start`). With Docker, the build can happen inside the image.  
- **Maintaining the Application:**  
  - *Updates:* Regularly update your application’s code with any improvements or security patches you develop. This might mean a `git pull` and restarting the server process, or redeploying the Docker container with a new image. Also update system packages occasionally (but be careful to not break dependencies; for example, if PostgreSQL is updated, ensure your data migrates correctly).  
  - *Monitoring:* Set up basic monitoring for uptime. You can use external services (or a simple cron job that hits an endpoint) to alert you if the app goes down. Monitor system resources on the VPS – ensure CPU/RAM usage is within limits (especially if running the AI calls which might consume memory for large responses). For a small number of users, this likely isn’t an issue.  
  - *Logs:* Aggregate your logs so you can troubleshoot issues. If using Nginx, check its access and error logs. Keep your app’s logs (you might integrate something like Winston for logging in Node or the standard logging in Python) and consider using a log rotation so they don’t grow indefinitely. You could also send logs to a service or at least back them up with the rest of data.  
  - *Backups:* As mentioned in security, maintain backups of user data (documents). If using a managed DB like Supabase or others, they might have automated backups. If self-hosting Postgres, schedule dumps. Verify occasionally that you can restore from these backups.  
  - *Scaling & Performance:* Given only 1–3 users, a single VPS (even a modest one, e.g., 2 CPU, 4GB RAM) is probably sufficient. But if those users store a lot of documents or use the AI heavily, watch your disk usage and network usage. The Anthropic API latency will dominate AI query performance, so not much you can do there except perhaps caching results of expensive operations (e.g., if you have a function to summarize a document, caching that summary so repeated asks don’t hit the API repeatedly). If someday user count increases, you might scale vertically (a bigger VPS) or horizontally (run multiple app instances behind a load balancer). With Next.js/Express, scaling horizontally means making sure sessions or JWTs are handled in a stateless way (or use a shared session store like Redis).  

- **Maintenance of Anthropic Integration:** Keep an eye on your usage of the Claude API – track how many calls and tokens are used to manage cost. Anthropic may update their API or models; plan to periodically check their announcements. Perhaps design the AI integration in a way that you can switch to a different model or provider with minimal changes, should the need arise (abstract the AI call behind an interface). For example, you could have a function `getAICompletion(prompt, context) -> result` that currently calls Claude’s API. If later you want to try OpenAI GPT-4 or a local model, you’d adjust that function.  

Deploying on your own VPS means you have the freedom to customize everything, but also the responsibility to **troubleshoot issues end-to-end**. It’s a good idea to document your deployment steps (maybe in a README for your project) so you can easily repeat them or recover if the server crashes. With a solid architecture and attention to security, your personal AI-powered document app should run reliably and serve your small team’s needs well.
