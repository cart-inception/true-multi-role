# Step-by-Step Plan: Autonomous AI Agent App (Multi-RoleAI)

### **Goal:**  
Build an autonomous AI agent web app called Multi-RoleAI that supports:
- Autonomous AI agent capabilities with independent task execution
- Multi-modal processing (text, code, web browsing)
- Tool integration (web browser, code editor, file system)
- User accounts with private workspaces
- Asynchronous task processing in the cloud

### **Tech Stack Recommendation:**  
- **Frontend:** React with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
- **Editor Components:** TipTap for rich text editing, Monaco for code editing
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes with Node.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication:** NextAuth
- **AI Integration:** Anthropic Claude API (or similar LLM with tool-use capabilities)
- **File Storage:** Local file system (for VPS deployment) or S3-compatible storage
- **Deployment:** VPS with Nginx as a reverse proxy and SSL (using Let's Encrypt)
- **Development Aid:** Windsurf Cascade to streamline code generation and refactoring
