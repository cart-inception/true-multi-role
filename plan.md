# Step-by-Step Plan: AI-Powered Document Editor App

### **Goal:**  
Build a web app (desktop-first, with mobile considerations) similar to Manus.im that supports:
- Rich document editing with AI-assisted writing (Anthropic Claude API)
- User accounts with private workspaces
- Document management (create, edit, organize)
- A chat-like interface for AI interactions

### **Tech Stack Recommendation:**  
- **Frontend:** React with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
- **Editor Component:** TipTap (or Slate.js) for rich text editing  
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes (or Express in Node.js)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (use an ORM like Prisma or TypeORM)  
- **Authentication:** NextAuth (or Passport.js for Express)  
- **AI Integration:** Anthropic Claude API  
- **Deployment:** VPS with Nginx as a reverse proxy and SSL (using Let’s Encrypt)  
- **Development Aid:** Windsurf Cascade to streamline code generation and refactoring

## **Phase 1 – Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**

1. **Project Initialization & Environment Setup**
   - **Repository & Project:**  
     - Create a new repository.
     - Initialize a Next.js project (or Node/Express if preferred).
   - **Dependency Installation:**  
     - Install React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and your chosen ORM (e.g., Prisma).
     - Set up a `.env` file for environment variables: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, DB credentials, session secrets, etc.
   - **Windsurf Cascade:**  
     - Ensure Cascade is configured to recognize your project structure for automated code suggestions and dependency management.

2. **Backend – Core API and Database**
   - **Database Schema:**  
     - Create tables/models for **User** (`id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`) and **Document** (`id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `content`, `created_at`, `updated_at`).
   - **Authentication API:**  
     - Implement user registration and login endpoints.
     - Use secure password hashing (bcrypt) and JWT or session-based auth.
   - **Document API:**  
     - Build CRUD endpoints:
       - `GET /api/documents` – list a user’s documents.
       - `POST /api/documents` – create a new document.
       - `GET /api/documents/{id}` – fetch a document.
       - `PUT /api/documents/{id}` – update document content.
       - `DELETE /api/documents/{id}` – remove a document.
     - Add middleware to enforce that users can only access their own documents.

3. **Frontend – UI and Editor**
   - **Authentication Pages:**  
     - Build login and registration pages with Next.js pages.
   - **Main App Interface:**  
     - Develop a dashboard with a sidebar for document listings.
     - Create a main editing area using a rich text editor (integrate TipTap or Slate.js).
     - Ensure the layout is desktop-first with responsive design.
   - **AI Chat Interface:**  
     - Add a chat component (sidebar or modal) for AI interactions:
       - Display conversation history.
       - Include an input for user prompts.
       - Add controls (e.g., “Insert AI response” button) to merge AI text into the document.

4. **Integrate Anthropic AI Assistant**
   - **Backend Integration:**  
     - Create an API route (`POST /api/assistant`) that:
       - Receives a user prompt (and optionally context such as selected text or document snippet).
       - Formats and sends a request to the Anthropic Claude API.
       - Returns the AI response.
   - **Frontend Integration:**  
     - Wire up the chat interface so that submitting a prompt triggers the API call.
     - Display the AI response in the chat and allow easy insertion into the document.

5. **Testing & Basic Error Handling**
   - **Functionality Tests:**  
     - Verify user authentication flows.
     - Test document CRUD operations.
     - Ensure AI endpoint returns correct responses and error states (e.g., API errors, timeouts).
   - **User Isolation:**  
     - Confirm that each user can only access their own documents.

## **Phase 2 – Enhanced Features & Refinements**

1. **UI/UX Enhancements:**
   - Improve editor capabilities (advanced formatting, Markdown preview, inline images).
   - Add loading spinners for AI responses.
   - Implement dark mode and other theme toggles.
   
2. **Advanced AI Interactions:**
   - Enable context-aware actions (e.g., “Summarize selected text,” “Improve this paragraph”).
   - Optionally implement streaming responses using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events.

3. **Document Organization & Sharing:**
   - Implement tagging/folder structures for documents.
   - Add document sharing with permission control (optional for later phases).

4. **Real-Time Collaboration (Stretch Goal):**
   - Consider using WebSockets with libraries like ShareDB or Yjs for live collaborative editing.

5. **Analytics & Admin Tools:**
   - Develop an admin dashboard for monitoring usage (number of documents, API call frequency).
   - Add logging and error tracking to improve reliability.

## **Phase 3 – Deployment & Maintenance on VPS**

1. **Server & Domain Setup:**
   - Set up your VPS (e.g., Ubuntu LTS) and install Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Git.
   - Point your domain to the VPS and configure DNS.

2. **Reverse Proxy & SSL:**
   - Install and configure Nginx (or Caddy) as a reverse proxy.
   - Set up HTTPS using Let’s Encrypt.

3. **Deployment Strategy:**
   - **Direct Deployment:**  
     - Use a process manager like PM2 (for Node.js) or Gunicorn (for Flask/Python).
   - **Docker Option:**  
     - Containerize the app and database using Docker Compose.
   - **Environment Variables:**  
     - Securely set environment variables and secrets on the VPS.

4. **Security Measures:**
   - Enforce HTTPS for all connections.
   - Regularly update system packages and app dependencies.
   - Configure firewall rules and rate limiting on authentication and AI endpoints.
   - Set up regular backups for the database.

5. **Monitoring & Logging:**
   - Implement logging for both the app and server.
   - Use monitoring tools to track uptime and performance.
   - Review logs regularly to identify and fix issues.

## **Integration Tips for Windsurf Cascade**

- **Modular Code:**  
  - Write clear, self-contained functions (e.g., `handleAuth`, `createDocument`, `callAnthropicAPI`) so that Cascade can easily locate and suggest improvements.
- **Code Comments & Naming:**  
  - Use descriptive names and comments to help the AI agent understand your intent.
- **Iterative Prompts:**  
  - Ask Cascade to generate boilerplate for new endpoints, components, or integration points as you add new features.
- **Dependency Management:**  
  - When adding a new package (e.g., a rich text editor), let Cascade verify imports and usage to minimize setup errors.
