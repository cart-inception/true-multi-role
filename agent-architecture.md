# Agent Architecture for Multi-RoleAI

## Overview

This document outlines the agent architecture for Multi-RoleAI, an autonomous AI agent application that can execute tasks independently across multiple domains. The architecture is designed based on Anthropic's best practices for building effective agents and incorporates elements from modern agent frameworks that are compatible with TypeScript and Next.js.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Orchestrator-Worker Model

Following Anthropic's recommended pattern, Multi-RoleAI will use an orchestrator-worker workflow:

- **Orchestrator Agent**: A central controller that breaks down complex tasks, delegates to specialized agents, and synthesizes results
- **Worker Agents**: Specialized agents with specific roles, expertise, and tool access

This approach allows for:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Specialized expertise in different domains
- Better task management and coordination
- Improved error handling and recovery

### 2. Role-Based Agent Design

Each agent in the system will have a clearly defined role with:

- **Name**: A unique identifier for the agent
- **Role**: The specific function the agent performs
- **Goal**: The objective the agent aims to achieve
- **Background**: Context and expertise that informs the agent's behavior
- **Tools**: The specific tools the agent has access to

### 3. Task Management System

Tasks will be managed through a structured system:

- **Task Decomposition**: Breaking complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks
- **Task Assignment**: Matching subtasks to the most appropriate specialized agents
- **Task Monitoring**: Tracking progress and status of all tasks
- **Task Completion**: Validating and synthesizing results from completed subtasks

### 4. Tool Integration Framework

Agents will interact with external tools through a standardized interface:

- **Tool Registry**: Central repository of available tools
- **Tool Schemas**: Clear definitions of tool inputs, outputs, and capabilities
- **Tool Access Control**: Permission system to control which agents can use which tools
- **Tool Execution**: Standardized method for invoking tools and processing results

### 5. Memory System

A persistent memory system will enable agents to:

- **Retain Context**: Maintain awareness of the current task and conversation history
- **Learn from Experience**: Improve performance based on past interactions
- **Share Knowledge**: Transfer information between agents when appropriate
- **Persist State**: Maintain state across user sessions

## Implementation Architecture

### Agent Framework

We will implement a custom agent framework inspired by AgenticJS and KaibanJS, optimized for TypeScript and Next.js:

```typescript
// Core agent interface
interface Agent {
  name: string;
  role: string;
  goal: string;
  background: string;
  tools: Tool[];
  llmConfig: LLMConfig;
  
  // Core methods
  process(input: string): Promise<AgentResponse>;
  useTool(toolName: string, params: any): Promise<ToolResponse>;
  updateMemory(key: string, value: any): void;
  retrieveMemory(key: string): any;
}

// Task management
interface Task {
  id: string;
  description: string;
  expectedOutput: string;
  status: TaskStatus;
  assignedAgent?: Agent;
  parentTask?: string;
  subtasks?: string[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  completedAt?: Date;
  result?: any;
}

// Team/Workflow management
interface Team {
  name: string;
  agents: Agent[];
  tasks: Task[];
  workflowStatus: WorkflowStatus;
  
  // Core methods
  start(): Promise<TeamResult>;
  assignTask(taskId: string, agentId: string): void;
  subscribeToChanges(callback: (updatedFields: any) => void, fields?: string[]): () => void;
}
```

### Specialized Agents

The Multi-RoleAI system will include the following specialized agents:

1. **Controller Agent**
   - Role: Orchestrator
   - Goal: Manage task planning, delegation, and synthesis
   - Tools: Task management, agent communication

2. **Research Agent**
   - Role: Information Gatherer
   - Goal: Find and summarize relevant information
   - Tools: Web browsing, search APIs, document analysis

3. **Writer Agent**
   - Role: Content Creator
   - Goal: Generate high-quality written content
   - Tools: Document editing, language processing

4. **Coder Agent**
   - Role: Developer
   - Goal: Write, debug, and execute code
   - Tools: Code editor, execution environment, version control

5. **Data Analyst Agent**
   - Role: Data Processor
   - Goal: Analyze and visualize data
   - Tools: Data processing libraries, visualization tools, database access

### State Management

The agent system will use a Redux-like state management pattern:

- **Centralized Store**: Single source of truth for the entire system
- **Actions**: Events that trigger state changes
- **Reducers**: Functions that update state based on actions
- **Selectors**: Functions to retrieve specific parts of the state
- **Subscriptions**: Mechanism to react to state changes

This approach enables:
- Predictable state updates
- Time-travel debugging
- Comprehensive logging
- Real-time UI updates

### Communication Flow

1. **User Input**: User submits a task or query
2. **Controller Processing**: Controller agent analyzes the input and creates a plan
3. **Task Assignment**: Tasks are assigned to specialized agents
4. **Tool Usage**: Agents use tools to accomplish their tasks
5. **Progress Updates**: System provides real-time updates on task progress
6. **Result Synthesis**: Controller agent combines results from specialized agents
7. **User Output**: Final result is presented to the user

## Best Practices from Anthropic's Research

### 1. Task Chaining

Break complex tasks into sequential steps, where each step builds on the previous one. This allows for:
- More focused agent work
- Better error handling
- Clearer progress tracking
- Higher quality results

### 2. Split the Work

Assign distinct responsibilities to different agents based on their specialization. This ensures:
- Better performance on specialized tasks
- Parallel processing when possible
- Clear separation of concerns
- More maintainable system architecture

### 3. Use an Orchestrator

Implement a controller agent that manages the overall workflow. The orchestrator:
- Breaks down complex tasks
- Assigns work to specialized agents
- Monitors progress and handles errors
- Synthesizes results into coherent outputs

### 4. Extensive Testing

Thoroughly test the agent system in sandboxed environments before deployment:
- Test with diverse inputs and scenarios
- Validate outputs against expected results
- Monitor resource usage and performance
- Identify and address edge cases

### 5. Optimize Tools

Focus on optimizing the tools agents use rather than just the prompts:
- Create clear, well-documented tool interfaces
- Use absolute references instead of relative ones
- Implement robust error handling in tools
- Provide helpful feedback when tools fail

### 6. Implement Feedback Loops

Create evaluator-optimizer workflows where one agent critiques the work of another:
- Use specialized review agents
- Implement structured feedback mechanisms
- Allow for iterative improvement
- Learn from past successes and failures

### 7. Control Costs

Implement measures to control the costs associated with autonomous agents:
- Set clear stopping conditions
- Implement budget constraints
- Create checkpoints for user review
- Monitor and optimize token usage

## Technical Implementation

### Framework Selection

For the Multi-RoleAI project, we will implement a custom agent framework inspired by:

- **AgenticJS**: For its role-based agent design and Claude API integration
- **KaibanJS**: For its task visualization and state management approach
- **LangChain.js**: For its extensive tool ecosystem and TypeScript support

### Integration with Next.js

The agent architecture will be integrated with Next.js:

- **API Routes**: Implement agent endpoints as Next.js API routes
- **Server Components**: Use React Server Components for agent UI
- **Client Components**: Create interactive components for agent interaction
- **WebSockets**: Implement real-time updates using Socket.io

### Database Schema

The agent system will use the following database schema:

```typescript
// User model
model User {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  name      String
  email     String   @unique
  password  String
  tasks     Task[]
  agents    AgentSession[]
  documents Document[]
}

// Task model
model Task {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  ownerId     String
  owner       User     @relation(fields: [ownerId], references: [id])
  title       String
  description String
  status      String
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  sessions    AgentSession[]
  parentId    String?
  parent      Task?    @relation("SubTasks", fields: [parentId], references: [id])
  subtasks    Task[]   @relation("SubTasks")
  result      Json?
}

// AgentSession model
model AgentSession {
  id                 String   @id @default(cuid())
  taskId             String
  task               Task     @relation(fields: [taskId], references: [id])
  userId             String
  user               User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  agentType          String
  conversationHistory Json
  status             String
  createdAt          DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt          DateTime @updatedAt
  memory             Json?
}

// Document model
model Document {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  ownerId   String
  owner     User     @relation(fields: [ownerId], references: [id])
  title     String
  content   Json
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}
```
